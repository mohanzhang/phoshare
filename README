This is a svn2git converted repository of Tilman Sporkert's excellent Phoshare
(http://code.google.com/p/phoshare/). While at the time of writing the latest
version was 1.5.2, svn trunk was only at 1.4.1. Some of the features described
on the homepage are therefore missing.

But that doesn't matter, because this repo exists solely to satisfy my own
export needs. If you want to carry on the Phoshare project, I would recommend
doing a more proper conversion of the original repo, which probably entails
converting all the branches (not just trunk).

My change on top of the last revision on trunk at the time of writing adds a
few hacks to the way the folder and image names are computed. Straight up
hacks, meaning that I didn't want spaces in the name of the exported folder or
filename. If you have the exact same requirements, then yeah, I suppose you can
use this version. Otherwise, it's a bad idea.

As a reminder to myself, I had to install pip and then get the gdata and pyttk
modules. I was then able to run it like this:

  python Phoshare.py  --export "/Users/mohanzhang/Pictures/phoshare" \
                      --iphoto "~/Pictures/iPhoto Library" \
                      --events "." \
                      --foldertemplate "{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}_{name}" \
                      --nametemplate "{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}_{index0}_{title}" \
                      --captiontemplate "{description}" \
                      --update \
                      --delete \
                      --verbose \
                      --dryrun

More notes-to-self: complaints about missing libraries might also be because I
used virtualenv:

- First create a virtualenv if there is none:
  $ python virtualenv.py phoshare

- For newly created virtualenvs, use:
  $ source bin/activate

- Then get the two requisite libraries:
  $ pip install pyttk
  $ pip install gdata



Original README follows below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


phoshare allows you to export and synchronize your iPhoto library to a 
folder tree. It preserves both the original and modified image, your event 
and album organization, and applies your iPhoto titles, descriptions, 
keywords, and face tags to the IPTC/EXIF metadata of your images. You can
export a full copy of your library, or just build a tree of linked images
that require very little additional disk space. You can re-run phoshare
at any time to synchronize any changes made in iPhoto to your export tree
quickly. phoshare works well with file-system based photo management
tools like Picasa or Adobe Bridge.

phoshare is written in Python, and can easily be customized.
